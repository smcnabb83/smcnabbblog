# Why this site?

Or, as you're more likely thinking, "Why another tech blog?" The short answer:

1. I like writing
2. I love tech

Starting up a blog seems like a great way to combine the two.

## What can we expect?

I'll be using this blog to discuss:

- **Technical Deep Dives** - deep dives into things I've wrestled with.
- **Career reflections** - the challenges of switching careers, blending IC and management, and the various lessons I've learned along the way.
- **Creative projects** - writing, music, games, and whatever else I'm experimenting with.
- **Other** - other things, yet to be determined.

## How are you qualified to write about tech stuff?

Short answer: I've built things people use. Sometimes it went well. Other times, not so much.

Longer, more serious answer: I've worked in software development for over a decade at this point. My other professional experiences include (in reverse-chronological order):

- IT
- Accounting
- Retail
- US Army
- Debt Collection
- Door-to-Door sales
- Personal Assistant

This gives me a wide variety of experiences to draw on, which I hope brings a unique voice to this landscape. Seriously, how many programmers can say they've sold vaccuum cleaners door to door?  

## How old ARE you?

42 years old, at the time of writing. 

## What do you hope to accomplish?

I hope my thoughts and experiences in our modern tech landscape can be helpful, or at least, entertaining.

## Wait, why is this a Q&A?

Because it's more fun that way!

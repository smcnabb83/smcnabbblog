Hi, I’m Sean McNabb. I’m a software engineering manager and developer with a background in modernizing .NET applications, building data pipelines, and navigating the messy landscape between legacy systems and cloud-native solutions.

I care about building systems that are maintainable, resilient, and clear. I believe that, when creating applications, the end user experience always comes first. I also enjoy mentoring engineers and helping teams set boundaries that keep promises realistic without cutting corners.

Right now, I’m exploring TypeScript/NestJS, AWS serverless patterns, and better approaches to UX in enterprise software. Outside of work, I write a fantasy web serial, tinker with music production in FL Studio, and occasionally dive into language learning projects.
